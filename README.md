Java solution for the TT December coding challenge


Challenge to display a 2d array as a grid and have a number of supply points (denoted by 0) and then all other elements are the distance they are from the nearest supply point.

For this implementation please:
  - Ensure Java is installed
  - Place the .jar in your chosen directory
  - Use cd "your directory" to navigate to the .jar location
  - Run the .jar using the command "java -jar DecChallenge.jar" and it will launch in command prompt
  - Enter the height, width, number of supply points and the coordinates of the supply points
  - Once entered the map should generate
  - If there are no valid supply points the map will show null
 
Eg.

With 0 being a supply point:

0 1 2 3 2 1 0 

1 2 2 3 3 2 1

2 2 1 2 3 3 2 

2 1 0 1 2 3 3 

Eg. 

With no valid supply points:

null null null null null null null

null null null null null null null

null null null null null null null

null null null null null null null

null null null null null null null
