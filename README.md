Java solution for the TT December coding challenge


Challenge to display a 2d array as a grid and have a number of supply points (denoted by 0) and then all other elements are the distance they are from the nearest supply point.

For this implimentation please:
  - Set supply point coords in file
  - Run and it will display as below
  - If there are no valid supply points the map will show null
 
Eg.

With 0 being a supply point:

0 1 2 3 2 1 0 

1 2 2 3 3 2 1

2 2 1 2 3 3 2 

2 1 0 1 2 3 3
