Java solution for the TT December coding challenge


Challenge to display a 2d array as a grid and have a number of supply points (denoted by 0) and then all other elements are the distance they are from the nearest supply point.

For this implimentation please:
  - Chose the number of supply points you want
  - Chose the x and y axis length for the map
  - Enter the supply point coords (remember the map starts at 0,0 !)
  - Then a 2d array called map will be generated and displayed
 
Eg.

With 0 being a supply point:

0 1 2 3 2 1 0 
1 2 2 3 3 2 1 
2 2 1 2 3 3 2 
2 1 0 1 2 3 3
